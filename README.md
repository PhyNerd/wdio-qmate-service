# Qmate WDIO service

Is an easy-to-use UI and E2E test automation [custom service](https://webdriver.io/docs/customservices/) based on [Webdriver.io](https://webdriver.io/).
It provides helpful reuse methods for any web application to write scripts more easily.


[Documentation is in process]


## Why wdio-qmate-service?

`wdio-qmate-service` allows you to use all the native webdriver.io commands and features, 
providing an access to [Reuse API](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/sProcurement/vyperForAll/blob/master/reuse/doc.md).

`wdio-qmate-service` provides you more flexibility than [qmate](https://github.tools.sap/sProcurement/qmate).


#### It allows you to choose WDIO features you prefer :
- [frameworks](https://webdriver.io/docs/frameworks/) (jasmin, mocha, cucumber), 
- compilers ([typescript](https://webdriver.io/docs/typescript/#compile--lint), [babel](https://webdriver.io/docs/babel/)), 
- reporters ([allure](https://webdriver.io/docs/allure-reporter), [html](https://webdriver.io/docs/rpii-wdio-html-reporter) etc.)
- [assertion libraries](https://webdriver.io/docs/assertion)
- services ([selenium](https://webdriver.io/docs/selenium-standalone-service), [chromedriver](https://webdriver.io/docs/wdio-chromedriver-service), [devtools](https://webdriver.io/docs/devtools-service) etc.)
- add logic to [WDIO hooks](https://webdriver.io/docs/options/#hooks)

## Getting started

To use `wdio-qmate-service` in your project:

**Step 1:** Install WDIO and initialize project (if your repo is empty and you want to create tests from scratch):

(if you've already had tests and configuration file, just skip step 1. and go to step 2.)

```shell script
npm i @wdio/cli
npx wdio config
```

**Step 2:** Add `wdio-qmate-service` as a devDependency:

```shell script
npm install <@wdio/qmate-service> --save-dev
```


**Step 3:** Add `wdio-qmate-service` as a service to your configuration file:

1) without `require` statement  (implicit import)

```js
exports.config = {
...
    services: [
                ["qmate"], 
                // all other services
    ]
...
}
```

2) with `require` statement (explicit import)
```js
const WdioQmateService = require("@wdio/qmate-service");
...
exports.config = {
  ...
    services: [
      [WdioQmateService],
      // all other services
    ]
...
}
```


**Step 4:** Run tests:
```shell script
npx wdio <path/to/your/config.js>
```


Please have a look at the following `tests` folders with examples:

### Notes

1. If you face such error `command not found: wdio`, remove your package-lock.json, run `npm cache clean --force` and run `npm install`.
We moved `@wdio/cli` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`, so you  just to refresh your local dependencies and cache.
   

2. Please, use `npx wdio <config file>` instead of `wdio <config file>`.

If you see an error 
```
'wdio' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

it means you try to use `wdio` as a command to execute tests suite.


3. It is not required to run `npm i` in root package, if you want to run tests ÃŸ there is no dependencies in wdio-qmate-service (only devDependencie)
