## GitHub Authentication
If you are not able to access GitHub normally (clone, pull, push, etc.), this can have multiple reasons.

### Permission
Check if you have the permission to push to the specific repository or branch. 
If you want to contribute to the Qmate project, please find the [Contribution](./contribution.md) section. If you want to contribute to a different project, please contact an administrator of this repository and ask him to add you as an contributor if not yet done.

### SSO Enablement
Since the login with username and password is not available any more in GitHub Enterprise, you need to generate and setup your personal **access token** to authenticate. Find more information under [SSO Enablement for GitHub.wdf.sap.corp](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/github/sso-enablement). The easiest way to setup the toke is by using Visual Studio Code.
