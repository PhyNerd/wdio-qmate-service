# Qmate Service
**Qmate Service** is a custom [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) Service for testing web applications and APIs built with TypeScript. It replaces the former [JavaScript version](https://pages.github.tools.sap/sProcurement/wdio-qmate-service/) of the service and enhances it with many improvements and new features.

!!! tip 
    Qmate Service is part of the **standalone** tool [Qmate](https://pages.github.tools.sap/sProcurement/qmate/) but can also be used **as custom service** for WebdriverIO. However, if you want to make use of all our features, we **recommend to use the standalone** version enabling all our custom services out of the box.

## Main features
The main features of this service are:

- [x] Supporting UI5 and OPA Selectors
- [x] Reuse API with useful functions for UI5 and any other type of web application
- [x] REST & OData API testing
- [x] Dynamic test data handling
